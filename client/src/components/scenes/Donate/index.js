								opportunity that exists in the 21st Century for coding-jobs
								should have access to high-quality, free or nominally priced
								resources to help them get there in hopes that they will
								pay-it-forward by helping/mentoring/speaking to others who wish
								to gain access to the industry" (Whiteboard Warrior events are
								free and always will be!)
